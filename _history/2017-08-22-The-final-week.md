Hey everyone! I'm back with another post regarding my GSoC journey so far. This is my final week into the GSoC and I'm really glad that I made it till the end.

First of all, here's a list of things that have done since my previous mid-phase post.
- All the warnings on the CLI are cleaned up now :)
- coala-quickstart has now this awesome feature of autocompletion for filesystem paths.
- coala-quickstart is now able to validate the input type based on the kind of settings.
- coala-quickstart can now automatically obtain setting values from `.editorconfig` values and can even detect the inconsistency.
- coala-quickstart now suggests bears based on your `Gruntfile.js` contents as well!
- The new version of coala-quickstart is released now :tada: (oh yeah.. This was my first release ever!)

With all that done.. I was able to complete my project in time and everyone would be satisfied with my work I guess :)

**Here's my final submission report:** [https://gist.github.com/satwikkansal/b72265a0d0ec678b9291ea8e21a398ec](https://gist.github.com/satwikkansal/b72265a0d0ec678b9291ea8e21a398ec)

## What's next for coala-quickstart?

There's still a long way to go for coala-quickstart and the most important thing to watch out for is the [aspects](https://github.com/coala/cEPs/blob/master/cEP-0005.md) project which will simplify the things for the users to a lot extent and will eventually open us a lot of opportunity for us to show some `coala-quickstart` magic.

PS: Another blog-post walking through my whole GSoC journey in brief will be coming soon and I'm trying to make it an interesting one. So until next time...
