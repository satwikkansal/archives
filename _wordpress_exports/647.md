# The perks of Open Source

Like a greedy fellow, I dived into the "Large as an ocean" world of Open Source Software and contribute to the most Intricate codebases things I've ever seen. But there are some things that I realized after going through a lot of organizations and thought they might be useful for others here as well, so I decided to blog them down. 

  1. The only things you need are: Time, passion, persistence, at least one Programming Language knowledge and you're good to go.
  2. If you're interested and are enjoying your contributions, everything else takes care of itself.
  You don't know `git`? don't worry it's not that tough to use `git` and Github.
  Don't know where to start, start from anywhere, but just start, you didn't knew to how to walk as well, but you can now walk only because you tried to.
  3. If you're contributing because of anything other than Interest, you'll soon find it as a burden.
  4. Git is your friend. Yeah! The more closer you know this friend the more easy your life would become.
  5. Ask for help but helps other more.
  6. Don't just keep doing what others say, be bold, discuss your views and approaches, try difficult issue, because the most valuable result of the Open source world is learning.
