Hi, welcome to my really personal space. Here I share some of my experiences/learnings as time passes by. There's a reason behind archiving all of my personal posts here.

A bit of flashback: I used to be a humblebragging jerk on social media by sharing posts of my achievements/places traveled and seeking gratification/validation in return from them. When I look back at my posts in retrospection, it feels like I was trying to create a "exciting image" of mine (like most people), but... I have grown the fuck up gave up on my old habits. I no longer share stuff that's self-centered and not interesting to the people who are "loosely connected" to me on Facebook (after all, if it's just about me and not helpful to you, it's downright annoying and I'm wasting valuable time of a lot of people).

So, here's the alternate plan...

From now onwards, this is where I'd try to share my updates (every sometimes). And if you're one of very few people who might actually be interested in knowing what I'm up to, this might be the place. Here are few of the posts (ordered by recency).

PS: If some of the ideas discussed in the posts really resonate with you, then feel free to ping me over and discuss more (I know it's weird to say this, but it's fun to hang around with people having similar taste)
