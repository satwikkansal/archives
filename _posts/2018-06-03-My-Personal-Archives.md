## Background story

A few years ago, I decided not to share stuff that's self-centered and un-interesting to people who are "loosely connected" to me on Facebook and other social-media (after all, if it's just about me and not helpful to you, it's downright annoying and I'm wasting time of a lot of people).

So, the alternate plan was to use this place to share my updates (every sometimes). And if you're interested in knowing what I'm up to, this might be the (only) place.
