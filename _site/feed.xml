It’s been quite a while since my last post. A lot has happened till then, but this post is just gonna be about the amazing experience that I had at PyCon India 2017. I’ve been buying Pycon ticket since the last 2 years, and ending up transferring it to someone else due to my university exams. But this time, I somehow managed to attend it :tada:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what all I did,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lead the Dev sprint for “First Open Source Contribution at coala”.
I was very excited about this. However due to some technical glitches, and non-functional internet at the spot, it didn’t go as well as expected. Anyways, we still managed to get a decent amount of newcomers onboard. And yeah, I got a chance to speak at PyCon. I also prepared a lightning talk for What the f**k Python?, but unfortunately my talk wasn’t picked in the lottery system. But anyways, I ended up partnering with @rj722 for the lightning talk about coala!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s1.postimg.org/4onq13f5v3/photo_2017-11-06_02-07-59.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Met with the awesome coalians (The coala contributors)
There were 9 people from coala. We had a fabulous community dinner at a barbecque place (Thanks to @sils and @damngamerz for arranging it), spent time discussing a lot of things at the coalaBnb, organized open spaces, distributed a hell lot of coala swags, gave lightning talks. It seemed like Pycon turned into coalaCon.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s1.postimg.org/23441l17yn/photo_2017-11-06_13-44-08.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s1.postimg.org/4zaju8tykv/photo_2017-11-06_02-10-36.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Didn’t attend even a single talk.
Well, this may seem crazy. I did attend one by fellow coalian @rj722 about Dead code removal using Vulture, but that’s all I attended. Instead, I spent time preparing slides for the Lightning talk, organizing open spaces for coala, having lunch (:p), and just hanging around with coala people.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s all I had to share for now. I hope the next PyCon event is going to be even more fun and learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s1.postimg.org/43e2eskxa7/photo_2017-11-06_02-07-50.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;^^ The coala gang!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: The past three months after GSoC have been like a roller coaster for me. I’ll soon be sharing a long blog post about them which you mayS find informative as well.

I’m back with another post regarding my GSoC journey so far. This is my final week into the GSoC and I’m really glad that I made it till the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, here’s a list of things that have done since my previous mid-phase post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All the warnings on the CLI are cleaned up now :)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;coala-quickstart has now this awesome feature of autocompletion for filesystem paths.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;coala-quickstart is now able to validate the input type based on the kind of settings.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;coala-quickstart can now automatically obtain setting values from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.editorconfig&lt;/code&gt; values and can even detect the inconsistency.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;coala-quickstart now suggests bears based on your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gruntfile.js&lt;/code&gt; contents as well!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The new version of coala-quickstart is released now :tada: (oh yeah.. This was my first release ever!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all that done.. I was able to complete my project in time and everyone would be satisfied with my work I guess :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s my final submission report:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/satwikkansal/b72265a0d0ec678b9291ea8e21a398ec&quot;&gt;https://gist.github.com/satwikkansal/b72265a0d0ec678b9291ea8e21a398ec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-next-for-coala-quickstart&quot;&gt;What’s next for coala-quickstart?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s still a long way to go for coala-quickstart and the most important thing to watch out for is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/coala/cEPs/blob/master/cEP-0005.md&quot;&gt;aspects&lt;/a&gt; project which will simplify the things for the users to a lot extent and will eventually open us a lot of opportunity for us to show some &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;coala-quickstart&lt;/code&gt; magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: Another blog-post walking through my whole GSoC journey in brief will be coming soon and I’m trying to make it an interesting one. So until next time…&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Satwik Kansal</name><email>satwikkansal@gmail.com</email><uri>http://satwikkansal.xyz</uri></author><category term="coala" /><summary type="html">Hey everyone!

I’m back with another post describing my GSoC journey so far since the last update (released in the final week of Phase 2). Here’s all that happened since then:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;coala-quickstart broke due to some changes in the public API of coalib just before 1 day of the evaluation deadline. Thanks to John for pointing it out and reverting the changes :)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I passed my second evaluation (yay!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;coala-quickstart’s CLI was overwhelmed with errors related to logging and a lot of irrelevant warnings (mostly fixed now :))&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Me and Adhityaa finalized and prioritized tasks for the third phase.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The tree became red!!! (Appveyor builds were failing due to upstream issues with lxml dependency)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I made couple of PRs to fix un-necessary errors and warnings on the CLI.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I made a PR adding some CLI improvements to quickstart:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;coala-quickstart will now support input validation for setting values entered by users.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;coala-quickstart now doesn’t ask users for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;language&lt;/code&gt; setting values reducing the amount of information the users have to input.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Users can now enter different strings for boolean setting values. Example, coala-quickstart now will recongnize strings like “Hell yeah!!!”, “Nope”, “Definitely”, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Initiated a PR for a terminal-like autocomplete feature in quickstart’s CLI for filesystem paths.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in my previous post, this phase involves improvements in existing interface of coala-quickstart. I’m trying to finish all the tasks mentioned in my proposal as soon as possible and manage some time to complete some stretch goals and finally make a release of coala-quickstart :tada:&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Satwik Kansal</name><email>satwikkansal@gmail.com</email><uri>http://satwikkansal.xyz</uri></author><category term="coala" /><summary type="html">Hey everyone!

I’m back with another post of my GSoC journey. I’m into my final week of Phase 2 and will be filling out the evaluations very soon (&lt;strong&gt;excited!&lt;/strong&gt;). This phase was essentially the &lt;strong&gt;core&lt;/strong&gt; of my GSoC project. Here’s what I’ve done in past two weeks since my last update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tldr&quot;&gt;TLDR;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Got the cEP (coala’s Enhancement Proposal) merged after review by my mentor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Performed a couple more iterations of my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GruntfileInfoExtractor&lt;/code&gt; PR and got it merged after reviews from my mentors and fellow GSoCers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Submitted a &lt;strong&gt;very long&lt;/strong&gt; PR for the actual implementation of my cEP and managed to get it merged after heavy reviews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s my burndown chart&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s1.postimg.org/zelq6z8tb/burndown.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty erratic this time because we decided to work on multiple issues a week so that we have a fair idea in mind of how everything is going to line up together to work in sync, and this is what I ended up with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s4.postimg.org/i4c9u9swd/Screenshot_from_2017-07-23_22-34-20.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: I realized that it’s better to manage 3-4 short PRs than one giant PR and had hard time in making changes to PR, maintaining logical order of commits, and having the all the CI services to successfully build the project with updated changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;diving-into-the-details&quot;&gt;Diving into the details&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GruntfileInfoExtractor&lt;/code&gt; PR is in good shape in my previous post, but it wasn’t! I had some silly mistakes and some code which had very high complexity be it be time complexity or cyclomatic complexity. I spent some more time to refine it after reviews and got it merged. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gruntfile.js&lt;/code&gt; has lot of metadata that can be useful for coala-quickstart to generate enhanced configuration file (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.coafile&lt;/code&gt;) for coala.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My cEP implementation can be seen broadly in terms of following 3 tasks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Autofilling values for settings of sections in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.coafile&lt;/code&gt; generated by coala-quickstart. Currently we use files like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.editorconfig&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gruntfile.js&lt;/code&gt; to achieve this. Also, coala-quickstart is now able to detect inconsistency in the various configurations across such files.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use information from dependency files (like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gemfile&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt;) to suggest relevant information for bears.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask users explicitly for capabilities they want for their bears and filter bears accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal of coala-quickstart is “To do all the boilerplate work for coala and generate a highly relevant &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.coafile&lt;/code&gt; without minimum possible user involvement(or no inovolvement at all in the ideal case)”. After all the above three mentioned tasks implemented, we get a step closer to achieve high automation and accuracy with quickstart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, coala-quickstart now works online! To try it out, go to https://coala.io/#!/coalaonline , and just enter your repository url (credits to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hemangsk&quot;&gt;Hemang&lt;/a&gt;). It’s in beta right now, so if you experience any glitches, feel free to report it &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/coala/landing/issues/new?issue&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have two choices now, either to go ahead with my proposal and make improvements to CLI and pursue some stretch goals if time allows or to further refine my work in Phase 2 and focus on “recommending relevant and useful Bears” to the users. We’ll be discussing this in next weekly meeting which is gonna happen very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/adtac&quot;&gt;Adhityaa&lt;/a&gt; (my primary mentor) for managing out sufficient time for the project even after his internship. Also, he has now completed his internship, and he’ll be available to help me more, but on the flip side, I’ve my campus placements starting from next week, so a lot of my time will get into studying and preparing for interviews for different companies. So it’s gonna be a big month ahead for me!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I know I’ll manage it somehow, and keep you guys updated. Stay tuned for updates…&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Satwik Kansal</name><email>satwikkansal@gmail.com</email><uri>http://satwikkansal.xyz</uri></author><category term="coala" /><summary type="html">Hello world!

I’m back with another post of my GSoC journey. Last week, I received an email from “Google Summer Of Code” and guess what? I passed my first evaluation : tada:.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s13.postimg.org/6zjnxw42v/hello.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mentors were very happy with my performance so far, and I’m really thankful for their support. Without wasting any time, I started working on the Phase 2 tasks just after submitting the Phase 1 evaluation, so coming back to my work here’s what I’ve done in the past two weeks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tldr&quot;&gt;TLDR;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proposed a cEP (coala’s Enhancement Proposal) for Information utilization process.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implemented and proposed a PR for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GruntfileInfoExtractor&lt;/code&gt; (for those who have not been following up my posts recently, an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;InfoExtractor&lt;/code&gt; class mechanism to extract useful information from files)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;diving-into-the-details&quot;&gt;Diving into the details&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in one of my previous posts that we shifted the integration of CI from phase 2 to phase 1, so the first thing that we decided to do in this phase was to complete the remaining tasks of phase 1, i.e. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GruntfileInfoExtractor&lt;/code&gt;. Unlike other &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;InfoExtractor&lt;/code&gt; classes implemented so far, the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GruntfileInfoExtractor&lt;/code&gt; turned out to be a bit complicated as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There’s no direct implementation of “Gruntfile.js” parser, so I had to make use of parse tree generated from [&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pyjsparser&lt;/code&gt;], a pypi package for parsing JS files.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The “Gruntfile.js” has very rich API, if we were to take into consideration every possible functionality offered by “Gruntfile.js”, it’d have easily taken more than two weeks to complete it. So we tried to follow the 80-20 principle and covered the most common usage for now.
Anyways, the PR is in a good state now, and I’m expecting it to get merged by the coming week after 1-2 review iterations by my mentor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, we decided to dedicate some time to plan the complete bear selection and filtering framework (which, no doubt is the core of my entire GSoC project), so I tried to thoroughly document my approach in the cEP and get it validate by my mentors. This will definitely make the review process much easier both for me and my mentors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Pull Requests got slightly big (~750 lines), so some decent amount of reviewing work to do by my mentor in the upcoming days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I’ll be working to actually implement the approach discussed in the proposed cEP with proper tests and documentation and hopefully, by the end of next week, I’ll have a PR ready for the core of my GSoC project which will make us to advance a step closer to making “coala-quickstart” great again! Until then, have fun and enjoy summers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: This week a lot of coala members will be meeting up at EuroPython 2017, and I really regret not being able to make it due to my campus placements coming up and some financial constraints (I spent a lot in previous Hackathons like MHacks). I still don’t know if I made a good decision or not as this event would have been an amazing learning experience for me as well, but anyways, I hope I’ll get another chance to meet the coala members in real life and a chance to speak in such a big conference very soon :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;some-nice-links&quot;&gt;Some nice links&lt;/h3&gt;

Excited, as always, I filled up my First Evaluation on Google Summer Of Code’s site, and probably my mentors have completed theirs as well (I had to write four long 2k word size answers in the evaluation form :P)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks a ton to my mentors &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/adtac/&quot;&gt;Adhityaa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Adrianzatreanu&quot;&gt;Adrian&lt;/a&gt; for helping me with my doubts in the weekly meetings, and reviewing and merging all my stuff. The meetings were fun (yeah, some sarcastic jokes when both of them were around :P) as well as informative. It helped all of us align on the same page at the end of every week. This week I had a quite rigorous discussion with Adhityaa regarding future tasks which went on till 2 hrs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, credits to finish my tasks in time goes to the admins who kept us pushing to complete all our milestones in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After phase 1, this is how my burndown chart looks like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please checkout https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC-2017/milestones/20 to see what all tasks I worked upon during the First Phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time I was more disciplined as compared to the bonding phase (the burndown chart reflects this as well :P)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-whats-next&quot;&gt;So what’s next?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We planned to get a cEP (coala’s Enhancement Proposal) proposed by the end of this week and try to make a PR for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GruntfileInfoExtractor&lt;/code&gt;, a module that extracts useful information from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gruntfile.js&lt;/code&gt; in projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As everything in this Phase needs to be designed intensively, we are planning to work on multiple tasks every week so that we keep in mind the bigger picture of how everything is going to work together at the end of the day, and reducing our chances of reaching a dead end because of immature design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks everyone for reading the post. I’m delighted to finish the first phase of my GSoC journey.&lt;/p&gt;

I hope you all are having a fantastic summer. The first phase of my GSoC project is about to end, and I’ll be soon filling up my evaluation. In this post, I’ll summarize my progress (like I’ve been doing in all my previous posts :p). Okay so here it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tldr&quot;&gt;TLDR;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s my progress since my last blog post (almost 2 weeks ago)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reiterated on Appveyor and Travis PRs and got them merged.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Went through multiple iterations of my Info Extraction framework’s PR, implemented some new cool features and got the PR merged : tada:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extracted information from the files:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gemfile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.editorconfig&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase 2, obviously! :P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I pulled the Continuous Integration tasks from Phase 3 of my proposal to Phase 1, I had to push some of the tasks as stretch goals. I and my mentors will be discussing the future tasks to pursue in the upcoming weekly meeting, and we’ll adjust the timeline accordingly (don’t worry I’ll update everyone once we finalize the tasks :P)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next Phase will majorly involve utilizing the information that I’ve been able to extract via my Info Extraction framework. It’s gonna be slightly tight as I’ve my campus placements upcoming (damn yes! days of anxiety are near) and I’ll have to prepare for them as well (fingers crossed :))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-deeper-dive-into-my-work&quot;&gt;A deeper dive into my work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two weeks, I underwent multiple iterations of my previous week’s work until they were in perfect shape (Oh yes, getting the code merged is much more exhausting than writing the code).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;travis-and-appveyor&quot;&gt;Travis and Appveyor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I was able to figure out the mysteries of Travis, CircleCI, and Appveyor. Now we have Travis, Circle CI, and Appveyor integrated into the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;coala-quickstart&lt;/code&gt; repository. This is a very useful step as I’ll be able to make sure my solution works flawlessly across different Operating Systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how the tree looks like now&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://s9.postimg.org/5ui96fyjj/Screenshot_from_2017-06-23_00-55-16.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember when I joined this Open Source world I used to consider these CI checks as “annoying mystery systems”:sweat_smile:, but later I realized their importance and appreciate the services they offer for free to the open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was disappointing the Travis builds for OSX took a crazy long time to start and I eventually ending up removing them from the configuration. I’m planning to try some other CI service for OSX if I finish early with my GSoC tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://enwp.org/User:Jayvdb&quot;&gt;John&lt;/a&gt; (@jayvdb) for helping me out with all this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-information-extraction-framework&quot;&gt;The Information Extraction Framework&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making several iterations to my basic version of cEP-0009, we ended up with a pretty robust module with some cool features, one of them being the “type signature” based information value validation. If you are wondering what that means, let me demonstrate with some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;def assert_type_signature(value, type_signature, argname):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Validates the value with the type_signature recursively. The type
    signature is either a single type object, or a collection of type
    objects or allowed values or type signatures.

    &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; assert_type_signature(3, int, &quot;var&quot;)
    True
    &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; assert_type_signature(3, (3,), &quot;var&quot;)
    True
    &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; assert_type_signature([3,4], ([int],), &quot;var&quot;)
    True
    &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; assert_type_signature([3.0 ,4], ([int, float],), &quot;var&quot;)
    True
    &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; assert_type_signature([3,4], ([1, 2, 3, 4],), &quot;var&quot;)
    True
    &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; assert_type_signature([&quot;foo&quot;, 420], [[str, int]], &quot;var&quot;)
    True
    &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; assert_type_signature(&quot;tab&quot;, {&quot;tab&quot;, &quot;space&quot;}, &quot;var&quot;)
    True

    :param value:          Object to be validated against ``type_signature``.
    :param type_signature: Object that describes allowed types and values for
                           the ``value``.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;^^ I was bit lazy and ended up copy-pasting the inline documentation :P The main idea being it will be able to enforce constraints on the possible values an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Info&lt;/code&gt; class can take in my framework. It’s very flexible, and you can give complicated type signatures like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;type_signature = ([str, int, 9.5], &quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;coala!&quot;, [[classA], [int]])
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, so let’s see what all values match the above type signature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;9.5&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[“some string”]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[4, 5, “another string”]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Hello”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[[4,2,1]]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what doesn’t match&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Foo”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5.7&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[2, 2.3]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[[“some string”]]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The outer tuple is just a container of multiple possible type signatures and has no role in type matching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was easy, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so after some iterations, I was finally able to get the concerned PR merged : tada:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implementing-infoextractor-classes&quot;&gt;Implementing &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;InfoExtractor&lt;/code&gt; classes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first phase, the files we ended up picking were&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;package.json&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gemfile&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;.editorconfig&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the implementation of the Information Extraction Framework, the only tasks that I need to focus on are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Parsing the file.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finding information from the parsed file.
Rest everything (locating files, storing information, validating information, validating filenames, representing information, etc.) is taken care by the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Info&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;InfoExtraction&lt;/code&gt; classes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lucky to find the Gemfile parser on PyPI, but for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.editorconfig&lt;/code&gt; We decided to make and use a custom parser derived from their “editorconfig-core-py” repository. Somehow I was able to make everything work together and make PRs of all three of them in a good-shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all folks! I’m not gonna bore you guys more (brevity is a dying art :P).

I saw statistics released from Google lately and was really happy to know that my university had the third highest number of GSoC students selected in the world :). Anyways, in this blog post I’ll summarize my work for these past two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tldr&quot;&gt;TLDR;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I was upto last two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implemented modules for representing information and extracting information.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Created upstream issues for some of the things, would be probably working on them on my own if time allows (stretch goals)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Added Appveyor continuous integration for windows.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Added Travis CI on my project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the upcoming weeks, I’ll be working on writing extraction modules for extracting information of interest to coala from common kinds of meta-files. If you’re wondering what these files are, well they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gruntfile.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gulpfile.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gemfile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.editorconfig&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-deeper-dive-into-my-work&quot;&gt;A deeper dive into my work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These 2 weeks have been a good learning experience to me. I got to learn more about Object oriented functionalities in python and I explored the world of hosted Continuous Integration and Delivery platforms in-depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;week-1&quot;&gt;Week 1&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary tasks for this week were to create a working prototype for the cEP (coala’s Enhancement Proposal) that I proposed. Having a cEP in advance made it easier for me to take design specific decisions (I’m kinda starting to like “plan well before implement” stuff approach as opposed to the Hackathon-like approaches where I just dived into implementation and the see where it ends up). I wrote extensive tests for both of my modules, namely &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Info&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;InfoExtctor&lt;/code&gt;. Another important decision that I had to make was the directory structure and location of these modules (should these go into &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;coalib&lt;/code&gt; or just remain in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;quickstart&lt;/code&gt;). After discussion with my mentors we agreed upon keeping them in quickstart’s repo only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already made a PR for my Week 1 and I expect to get it merged soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;week-2&quot;&gt;Week 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After weekly meeting of Week 1, we ended up modifying our proposed timeline. As suggested by one of the maintainers (John), we shifted the continuous Integration tasks from Phase 3 to Phase 1 and decided to push everything in the timeline downwards by 1 week. I believe that it was a good decision because it is better to catch and fix platform specific issues earlier during implementation rather than having them reported later (prevention is better than cure!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the second week, I worked on adding Continuous Integration platforms Appveyor and Travis CI to coala-quickstart similar to other existing coala repositiories. It turned out to more reigorous and complicated than I expected and I ended up making around ~90 attempts to get all of them working at once (that’s probably due to my wrong approach of doing things the hit-and-trial way, I should have understood concepts first and then tried to build things from scratch, but nevermind, that’s how you learn :P). Finally I ended up making them work successfully and I’m very happy about it (earlier I used to shy away from issues related to CI but I don’t think now I’ll ever do that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after the first two weeks, I was able to set up a basic structure and CI system for my upcoming Tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all folks!

Looks like I’ll be all set to code after 1 week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I was upto past two weeks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I introduced myself and my project on the mailing lists.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Disucssed my projects with my mentors and made adjustments to my timline.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Did some research on the meta-files and the information to work on during my first phase of the project.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Created milestones and issues on Gitlab to keep track of my progress over the entire GSoC period.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proposed a cEP (coala Enhancement Proposal) regarding approach in Phase 1 of my project.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Managed to get past my theory exams somehow :P , still left with Minor Project and Winter-training viva.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;:tada: That was the most exciting moment in past few months as I finally acheived my 2-year awaited GSoC dream. I started contributing to &lt;strong&gt;coala&lt;/strong&gt; since the very first day of 2017 (Not a new year resolution though :P) and no doubt, the journey so far had been awesome and offered me a lot of opportunities to learn and grow as a developer. The last few months have indeed been bit hectic but the outcomes have been worth every effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month is officialy a “community-bonding-period”. As I’m already familiar with the community as well as the codebase of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;coala-quickstart&lt;/code&gt;, I plan to do extensive research about implementation of my project in this period so that I don’t face much difficulties during the upcoming “coding-phases”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PS:&lt;/strong&gt; There’s gonna be &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of upcoming blog-posts regarding my GSoC journey and the new things that I learn on my way.
